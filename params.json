No really, the plugin is purely programatic. Youâ€™re free to use whatever markup you wish. Just add `data-bind=\"hours\"`, `data-bind=\"minutes\"`, and `data-bind=\"seconds\"` to have the timer automatically update your content.\r\n\r\nAlternatively you could just bind to the `downtime.update` and handle the lot yourself.","google":""}
